# tr-nostr: nostroots

How to dissolve trustroots into nostr:

1. a nostr app
2. a relay server


## nostroots app 

- basic hospitality app
- fork off [existing app](https://www.nostr.net/)?
- how to do profiles?


## nostroots relay

Limited access to the nostroots relay

- you can only post if you have credentials
- you can only read if you have credentials
- users can additionally choose to connect to other relay servers


Thereâ€™s also already authenticated relays. So only authenticated users can post.


## Goals

sufficient decentralization:
- anyone can run and fork the relay server
- anyone can fork app


### ideas

We could even cut off signups for the relay and let other folks take over. Force decentralisation politically, but might not be necessary.



## Background

Hospitality Club was the biggest hospex in 2004, depended on one person, website down in 2024. CouchSurfing(tm) sold out to venture capital. Other networks are based on proprietary software and/or charge money to be a member.   We think it is worth our time and energy to work towards gift economy social networks that do not rely on any specific person or organization (so we want to make ourselves redundant).
