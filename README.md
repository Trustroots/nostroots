# tr-nostr: nostroots

How to dissolve trustroots into nostr:

1. a nostr app
2. a relay server


## nostroots app 

- basic hospitality app
- fork off [existing app](https://www.nostr.net/)?
- how to do profiles?


## nostroots relay

Limited access to the nostroots relay

- you can only post if you have credentials
- you can only read if you have credentials
- users can additionally choose to connect to other relay servers


Thereâ€™s also already authenticated relays. So only authenticated users can post.


## Goals

sufficient decentralization:
- anyone can run and fork the relay server
- anyone can fork app


### ideas

We could even cut off signups for the relay and let other folks take over. Force decentralisation politically, but might not be necessary.



## Background

Hospitality Club was the biggest hospex network in 2004, depended on one person, website down in 2024. CouchSurfing(tm) sold out to venture capital. Several other networks are based on proprietary software and/or charge money to be a member.   We think it is worth our time and energy to work towards gift economy social networks that do not rely on any specific person or organization, so effectively we want to make ourselves redundant.

The Nostr protocol is a decentralized, open network for social networking and messaging, using cryptographic keys for identity verification.

It is good there are now hospex networks running on open source free software that are free to use, apart from Trustroots there are also [BeWelcome](https://www.bewelcome.org/) and [Couchers.org](https://www.couchers.org/).

### How is Nostr different?

**Data Ownership:** In Nostr, users own their data. They can choose where to store it and which Nostr clients to use for interaction. This is in stark contrast to e.g. CouchSurfing(tm), where the company owns and controls user data, including its usage and monetization.

**Decentralization:** Unlike all existing hospitality networks, which are controlled by a single company or organization, Nostr is decentralized. It doesn't rely on a central server or entity. Instead, it operates through a network of independent servers, allowing for greater resistance to censorship and central control.

**Identity Verification:** Nostr uses cryptographic keys for identity verification. Each user has a unique pair of keys (public and private) for identity and authentication, contrasting with reliance on user-provided information like email or phone number that is used on almost all existing networks.
