# Cursor Rules for Nostroots

## Nostr Standards

When implementing Nostr features, refer to the official NIPs (Nostr Implementation Possibilities) repository:
- https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips

## Committing nr-web Changes

When committing changes that only affect `nr-web`, skip the pre-commit hooks because:
- `nr-web` is a standalone HTML file and doesn't use the same tooling as `nr-app`
- The pre-commit hooks run ESLint on `nr-app` which can fail for unrelated reasons
- See `nr-web/README.md` for more details

Use `--no-verify` flag when committing nr-web changes:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Your commit message"
```

## Committing Workflow Changes

When committing changes that only affect GitHub workflows (`.github/workflows/`), skip the pre-commit hooks because:
- Workflow files are YAML configuration and don't need ESLint validation
- The pre-commit hooks run ESLint on `nr-app` which can fail for unrelated reasons

Use `--no-verify` flag when committing workflow changes:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Your commit message"
```
