# tr-nostr: nostroots

How to dissolve trustroots into nostr:

1. a nostr app
2. a relay server


## nostroots app 

- basic hospitality app
- fork off [existing app](https://www.nostr.net/)?
- how to do profiles?


## nostroots relay

Limited access to the nostroots relay

- you can only post if you have credentials
- you can only read if you have credentials
- users can additionally choose to connect to other relay servers


Thereâ€™s also already authenticated relays. So only authenticated users can post.


## Goals

sufficient decentralization:
- anyone can run and fork the relay server
- anyone can fork app


### ideas

We could even cut off signups for the relay and let other folks take over. Force decentralisation politically, but might not be necessary.
