# tr-nostr: nostroots

How to dissolve trustroots into nostr:

1. a nostr app
2. a relay server

## nostroots app 


## nostroots relay

Access to the nostroots relay is limited.

- you can only post if you have credentials
- you can only read if you have credentials
- users can additionally choose to connect to other relay servers


Thereâ€™s also already authenticated relays. So only authenticated users can post.


## Goals

- can run their own relay server and promote it
- can fork the nostr app and do whatever they want with it

## ideas

We could even cut off signups for the relay and let other folks take over. Force decentralisation politically, but might not be necessary.
